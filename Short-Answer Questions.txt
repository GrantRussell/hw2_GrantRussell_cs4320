(a) I don't think they use stemming, or at least something as simple as a porter stemmer.  I tested two queries, "running to the store" and "run to the store".  They both returned different results, meaning it didn't stem 'running'.
(b) I think that Google doesn't ignore stop words.  I tested "run to the store" and "run store" expecting it to filter 'to' and 'the', but it returned unique results for each query.
(c) Yes it does use a spell checker, I tried the two queries "Donald Trump" and "Donlad Trmup", but they both returned the same result.
